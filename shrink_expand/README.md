# Shrink Expand

This directory contains source code not part of the primary scheduler used to communicate with running malleable programs.
Two communicators are provided:

- APGAS for Java malleable programs
- Charm++ programs (copied from the [Charm++ repository](https://github.com/UIUC-PPL/charm/tree/v6.10.2/examples/charm%2B%2B/shrink_expand))
